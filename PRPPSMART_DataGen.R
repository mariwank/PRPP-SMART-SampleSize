  #Purpose: These functions assign the preference of each individual based on the true propensity for exhibiting 
  #         a preference for treatment A, B, or having no preference in stage 1 and treatment C, D, or having no
  #         no preference in stage 2. Note, pref_probx is a Nx3 matrix with the

  ### Preference Model: Stage 1 Propensity Scores for Preference ###
  #    Here we generate preference for first stage treatment for each patient. The true propensity for exhibiting a 
  #    preference for treatment A, B, or having no preference for each subject in the simulation population 
  #    is modeled using a logit model approach where first-stage propensity scores for preference are conditional on the 
  #    first-stage baseline covariates X1 and X2. In our preference model, 
  #    we search for an intercept via the uniroot function in r which allows us to control the proportion of subjects exhibiting 
  #    no preference/preference for A/B

  ### Stage 1 treatment assigned ###
  #    For each subject in the simulated population we generate their stage 1 assigned treatment

  ### Generate Stage 1 Response variable ###
  #    For each subject we generate a binary response where 1 indicates the subjects responds

  ### Prefernce Model: Stage 2 Propensity Scores for Preference ###
  #    Here we generate preference of second stage treatment only for first-stage non-responders. Patients who respond
  #    continue on the stage 1 treatment. The true propensity for exhibiting a 
  #    preference for treatment C, D, or having no preference for non-responders in the simulation population 
  #    is modeled using a logit model approach where second-stage propensity scores for preference are conditional on whether
  #    the patient had a preference in stage 1. In our preference model, 
  #    we search for an intercept via the uniroot function in r which allows us to control the proportion of non-responder subjects 
  #    exhibiting no preference/preference for C/D
